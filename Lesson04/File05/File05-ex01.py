# Write a simple program that does:

# 1. Starts with 1000 dollars.

# 2. If the amount is positive:
#        print "You still have ______ dollars in your account."
#        Ask the user "How much do you want to withdraw?"
#        Convert the user's input into decimal/float.
#        And deduct the withdrawn cash from the total amount.

# 3. If the amount is negative:
#        exit the while-loop.
#        and print "You have run out of money!"

#        In this simple version of the game, we do not allow the customer to leave 
#        until the customer has finish withdrawn all money.
