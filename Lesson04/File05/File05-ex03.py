# Write a simple program that does:

# 1. The monster starts with 100 health.

# 2. If the health is positive:
#        print "The monster still has ______ health."
#        create a pause point, "Press ENTER to attack the monster"
#        Randomly generate a number between 1 to 6.

#    2a. If the number is 1 to 5, 
#             then deduct that number from the monster's health.
#    2b. If the number is 6,
#             then print "Critical hit! The monster took 20 damage."
#             and deduct 20 from the monster's health.

# 3. If the amount is negative:
#        exit the while-loop.
#        and print "You have defeated the monster. You win!"
