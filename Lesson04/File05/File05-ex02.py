##################################

# Write a simple program that does:

# 1. The monster starts with 100 health.

# 2. If the health is positive:
#        print "The monster still has ______ health."
#        create a pause point, "Press ENTER to attack the monster"
#        Randomly generate a number between 1 to 10.
#        And deduct the attack power from the monster's health

# 3. If the health is negative:
#        exit the while-loop.
#        and print "You have defeated the monster. You win!"
