# "Lucky-seven" game, also called "Seven-up" game

# We are playing a slightly modified version.
# Write a code that does:

# For each number from 1 to 50,

# If the number is divisible by 7, OR if the number ends with the number 7,
#     prints "Lucky-seven!"
# Else, print out the original number.

# Some example numbers that will trigger lucky-seven includes 7, 14, 17, 21, 27, 28, 35, 37, ......
