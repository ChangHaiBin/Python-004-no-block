# Write a simple program that prints out:
# 100, 99, 98, 97, 96, ......, 52, 51, 50.

# Your output should be like:
# "Your number is 100"
# "Your number is 99"
# "Your number is 98"
#      etc. etc. 

# Notice that the numbers are in decreasing order.
# The next number, 49, is not printed.

# Learn to set up your own while-loop.
# You can add in input("Press ENTER to continue") to help you slowly test your code.
