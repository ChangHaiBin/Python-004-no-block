# Write a simple program that does:

# 1. Starts with 1000 dollars, and a userQuit indicator representing False.

# 2. If the amount is positive, and the user has not quit:
#        print "You still have ______ dollars in your account."
#        Ask the user "How much do you want to withdraw?"

#    2a. If the user's input is "QUIT", 
#        print "You have exited the bank."

#    2b. Else, if the user's input can be converted into a decimal/float, 
#        deduct the withdrawn cash from the total amount.

#    2b. Finally, if the user's input cannot be converted into a decimal/float 
#        print out "Invalid input. Please try again."


# 3. If the amount is negative, or if the user has quit:
#        exit the while-loop.

#    3a. If the remaining amount is positive,
#        print out "You have ______ dollars remaining. You have exited the bank."

#    3b. If the remaining amount is negative,
#        print out "You have no more money left. The bank has kicked you out!"
