# Write a simple program that does:

# 1. Starts with 1000 dollars.

# 2. If the amount is positive:
#        print "You still have ______ dollars in your account."
#        Ask the user "How much do you want to withdraw?"

#    2a. If the user's input cannot be converted into a decimal/float 
#        So, there might be an "exception" or error.
#        print out "Invalid input. Please try again."

#    2b. If the user's input can be converted into a decimal/float, 
#        But the decimal/float is a negative number,
#        print out "You cannot withdraw a negative amount of money"

#    2c. If the user's input can be converted into a decimal/float,
#        And it is a positive number,
#        deduct the withdrawn cash from the total amount.

# 3. If the amount is negative:
#        exit the while-loop.
#        and print "You have run out of money!"

#        In this simple version of the game, we do not allow the customer to leave 
#        until the customer has finish withdrawn all money.
